Health is one of the most crucial factors to happiness. Deep Learning models offer the opportunity to improve the identification of different diseases. With our project we aim to exploit that potential to accurately identify COVID-19 from chest x-rays. Therefore, we trained a convolutional neural network using PyTorch. The binary classification model differentiates between covid-19 and normal patients with an accuracy of 94 percent.

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database. As uploading data failed, a short description of dataprocessing will follow. Pictures were already tagged with two classes: 1) 'normal' and 2) 'covid'. We splitted all data into train and test sets while remaining the substructure of the two classes.
